This project is a Tax Return Analyzer.

This is a project that I originally coded in Python for a class. I have edited it since and made it into a user-input program.

I have left some files on the program that is an example of its file writting usage. You can pick any of the 50 states or any US territory for the program. The directions of the project are listed at the begining of it. 

In order to start the program, just run the program as usual.
